The goal of this project is to learn how to do continuous delivery. 
I've been reading the great book by Jez Huble and David Farley - [Continuous Delivery][cd], and wanted to practice all of this on a new clean project. Until now, I've done bits and peaces for old projects without much of an impact other than the deployment stage. Now I want to make a proof of concept for me and my coworkers if this stuff works. I must admin that I'm not going back to my old ways.
